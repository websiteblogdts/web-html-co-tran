      <td><h2>E-waste is any kind of electronic equipment that has reached the end of its life and is no longer needed. This can include computers, printers, TVs, phones, microwaves, DVDs, and many more.</h2>
       <p>The amount of e-waste produced each year is increasing as technology becomes obsolete. The amount of e-waste is growing between 3-4% each year and is expected to be over 70 million tons by the end of the decade. Businesses produce a lot of e-waste, and it can be difficult to know how to dispose of it properly. </p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <p>Much of the e-waste produced each year is not properly recycled and ends up in landfills. This is a problem because when e-waste decomposes, it can leach harmful toxins into the environment.

            In addition to the environmental concerns, there is also the issue of e-waste security to consider. When businesses dispose of old hardware, they may be leaving sensitive data vulnerable to being recovered by third parties.
            
            This can lead to fines and loss of reputation for the business. For example, a business might recycle an old computer by sending it to a e-waste company. However, the e-waste company may resell the computer, leading to the data on the computer being vulnerable to being recovered by third parties.
            
            A study by the University of Hertfordshire showed that 2/3 of second hand USB sticks data was still accessible. This can lead to massive problems for a business if this data ends up in the wrong hands.

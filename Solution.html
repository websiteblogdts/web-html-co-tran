<div class="article-text"><h2>2. How to dispose of waste and recycle electronics.</h2></div>

<div class="article-text">
    <p>
        Here are six ways for you to deal with e-waste from electronics recycling, to donate them locally.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="article-text">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1 Reduce: Consider re-evaluating whether the product you want to replace is really necessary. Think about whether you and your family need these before making a new purchase.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 Reuse: Instead of upgrading or replacing things, help them last longer by making sure they're protected with a case, screen protector, insurance, and more. Make sure you take care rather than treat the disposable product as replaceable. If you want to clean and reuse them, check out our guides on how to troubleshoot spills on electronics and how to clean laptops and other devices</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3 Recycle: Recycling electronics doesn't mean putting them in your recycling bin, but many local waste centers will recycle electronics..</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>4 Upgrade: If your electronics are no longer working, that doesn't mean they can't be upgraded to new things around your home. For example, if your laptop is no longer functional but the screen is intact, add it as a second monitor to your workspace..</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>5 Sell: If you have working electronics like TVs, washing machines, computers, dishwashers, etc., look around to see if you can sell them online or for local cash. whether the store sells the product or not.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
